## TO DO list
Todo list for the Keyboard, now that it's in a workable state:
1. ~Get the red LED to reflect CAPSLOCK status~ Done already via HID service callback
2. Debouncing (maybe something derived from QMK/TMK code?)
3. Build the right half of the keyboard
4. Build a more robust matrix with copper tape instead of wires
5. Secure pairing with key-in (a la the palm 3245WW)
6. Ability to store multiple BT credentials and switch between them.
7. Implement some form of Poweroff
8. Better function key handling, to include Keyboard meta-control
9. Battery status update via BAS
